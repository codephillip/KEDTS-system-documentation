1.1 About the Kampala Emergency Digital Transport System
############################################################
The Kampala Emergency Digital Transport system was developed as part of a three year grant for
the Kampala Slum Maternal and New-born Health (MaNe) project funded by USAID. The goal of the
MaNe project is to generate evidence on effective and feasible interventions to improve Maternal
and Newborn Health for the urban poor in Kampala. This 3-year USAID funded implementation
research effort is testing innovative approaches to address the demand and supply-side barriers
affecting care-seeking, effective referral and transport challenges and provision of quality care for
urban poor. From the statistics of the KCCA 24-hour emergency call and dispatch centre between
March and May 2020, up to 96% of the emergencies transported using the existing ambulance
system were maternal and newborn health emergencies. The primary beneficiaries of this system
are pregnant women and newborn babies although this system is designed to cater to all
emergency referrals. From its inception, this system was created to achieve the following
objectives;

- To map and connect all ambulances, public and private in Kampala, privately owned
  vehicles for referral and linkage purposes.
- To develop a functional triaging system that links patients in communities to 
  facilities and ambulances to enable patient transfer
- To capture data and generate reports for decision making in emergency maternal 
  referral services.

The Kampala Emergency Digital Transport system has different interfaces namely: Call Centre
interface, health facility interface and the ambulance application which all work concurrently. This
user guide will focus on the usage of the health facility interface.
